* If the choice between Length and Width appears arbitrary (e.g. a bin of dimensions 2" by 5" and 1" Depth) prefer assigning the longer side as the Length
* Measurements should be followed by the inches symbol (") (e.g. 6")
* Measurements requiring fractions should have a space between the whole number and the fraction 
  (e.g. 6 1/2" not 61/2")
* No ending zero after whole numbers (e.g. 6" not 6.0")



### Inches (Decimal) ###
* Generally the overall length of the instrument identified in inches in decimal format
